I would like to think that I'm slightly different from the majority of the people applying for Goldman Sachs. I am intensely ambitious. In my last internship, I was always asking my manager if I could work on different projects that would help me broaden my skillsets. I am a creative and innovative person and I get a lot of job satisfaction when I'm helping to create a new and exciting product or service for my employer's customers or clients. I am intensely competitive, but at the same time understand that the organizations' needs must come above my own and I will always work collaboratively with my co-workers and stakeholders to ensure that you stay at the forefront of the sector. What I am trying to say is, I feel I can bring something unique to the Amazon team because I genuinely want to work in a diverse culture and be pushed and challenged in my role so that I continually improve and develop. 

WHY Goldman Sachs - 

I want to work at Amazon for several reasons. Firstly, you are the best at what you do. Working at Amazon means I will be pushed continually, I will get to work with some of the brightest minds in the Technology sector, and I will have the ability to work for a diverse range of clients which will help me to improve and develop my communication and interpersonal skills. Another reason I have chosen Amazon is you care about the future generation. You recently hosted a "Next Generation Summer Series" where attendees were able to listen to experts on subjects such as Investing, career development, entrepreneurship, and sustainability. Experts and Influencers from all around the world gave their time to educate and inform the next generation of innovators and change-makers which I felt was indicative of your forward-thinking approach to your business and how you want to stay at the top of the sector. 

DEAL WITH DIFFICULT SITUATIONS - 

I was managing the creation of a new website for a client that was supposed to launch in two weeks. One of our senior team members found a major bug in the code and he wanted to push back on the deadline, which I knew the client wouldn’t appreciate. I understood the editor's push to move the deadline but I also knew the client has to have the website running on time. I didn’t want to push him and the team too hard but instead focused on finding out what they need that could help solve the situation. We created a list of things we could delay and work on after the launch and put the effort into fixing the bug to allow the launch – even if not in the most perfect way possible. In the end, the team understood the priorities and we were able to work together to direct resources where they were needed. In the end, we launched the website on time, increasing company sales by 20% in the first week and we had the fully functional site within 2 weeks of launch.


WORK IN A DIVERSE TEAM - 

Diverse teams drive innovative solutions precisely because they can be challenging. By bringing diverse perspectives to the table, you get more ideas, but also more people pointing out holes in ideas. The debate that can come with differing perspectives pushes everyone to think and work harder. That is one of the most challenging aspects of working in a diverse environment, but it’s a challenge I embrace. For example, if I notice that we’ve gotten to a solution fairly easily but that we haven’t heard from someone on the team, I’ll ask that person to weigh in on the solution. I’ve found that on many occasions, inviting someone into the conversation might mean we’re debating an issue longer, but it also means that we end up with a stronger solution.


DIFFERENT CULTURE

I think I excel in new and challenging situations. I've never been one to be daunted by an unexpected issue because I find remaining calm helps you find better solutions. I enjoy getting to know new colleagues and settling into an organization's methodology fairly quickly.

No two jobs or tasks are ever the same, so I find it is best to always anticipate unforeseen problems. I've worked in fast-paced positions before, so I'm confident in my ability to identify and solve problems under pressure.

DEAL WITH DIFFICULT CLIENT?

I am a firm believer in the customer comes first. I’ve learned to not take the things that customers say about their experience personally, which really helps when it comes to diffusing the situation. I always try to really understand the complaint and do the best I can to solve the issue. If they are really upset I would then get the manager. Sometimes they just want to talk to a manager to know that their complaints are being heard.

 I’m an empathetic person who is skilled at relating to people and understanding their needs. At one of my internships over the summer, I was working in the support line for a week and received a call from a disgruntled customer who had been dropped from our service. While the company couldn’t find a solution for her, I walked her through other options she might have so she walked away with a positive interaction with the company. I know the importance of a happy customer, and I'm willing to remain upbeat and solutions-oriented.

FACE A DIFFICULT PROBLEM?

While working in my first Internship as a Technical content writer, I accepted article assignments from an online queue. I was eager to showcase my abilities, so I accepted more than I could handle. While I tried my best to meet all the deadlines, it wasn't possible to submit them all without sacrificing quality. I was very transparent with my supervisor and told them what had happened. They reassigned some of the work to available team members. I learned to not take on more than what I can handle and to prioritize quality when submitting articles.

weakness - 
I tend to be overly critical of myself. Whenever I complete a project, I can’t help but feel that I could have done more even if my work received a positive response. This often leads me to overwork myself and leaves me feeling burned out. Over the past few years, I’ve tried to take time to look at my achievements objectively and celebrate those wins. This has not only improved my work and my confidence, but it has helped me to appreciate my team and other support systems that are always behind me in everything I do.

CONFLICT IN TEAM

I was working in a startup recently. Our marketing team had to build and implement a new digital marketing campaign, and I was assigned to oversee the project and delegate tasks to each team member. One employee was upset that I was chosen to lead the campaign over them and refused to complete their tasks. I asked them to meet privately to learn why they were upset.

I listened to their side and told them that I understood where they were coming from. I explained that if they work hard with our team to submit a strong project, our supervisor may notice this and consider them for other promotions or responsibilities in the future. They agreed and completed their tasks, which led to a 20% customer conversion rate and high praise from our supervisor.

DECISION MAKING - / WORKING IN TEAM

This would be my first salaried position, but I made plenty of decisions in college. For example, during a team project, I remember that one of our teammates didn't show up to the last meeting. We still had to put the finishing touches on our project, and we were unable to contact the missing individual.

The team and I discussed our options. We decided that waiting might only waste what little time we had left. We chose to focus on our assigned work, and once we finished, we split up the missing individual's assignment among ourselves. Working together, we finished the project and turned it in the next day.

QUESTIONS AT THE END - 

If I were hired for the position, would I be going through any training prior to actually starting the work?
